# My Portfolio

## Description:
 This was a challenge in advanced CSS in which I created a personal portfolio to showcase my skills and talents to employers.

I created a webpage which includes:
* a header with my name and links to sections about me, my work, contact information, as well as my resume
* functional navigation links which allows UI to scroll to the corresponding section
* an "About Me" section which includes a recent avatar and a bio
* a section outlining my previous works which includes titled images of my applications as well as working links to the project. The first application is presented in a size larger than the others
* For the most part, the page is responsive to different viewports, but not completely as some elements are sized in a fixed ratio
